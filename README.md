GOAP - A C++ implementation of Goal-Oriented Action Planning AI in UE4.25
=============

This plugin is meant to be re-usable for any UE4 projects that require a GOAP approach to AI for the game.  
The system is written in C++ and extendable to blueprints for easy customization and rapid workflow.
Actions and goals can be added to distinct AI types as needed for better dynamic AI behavior.

Overview
--------
### Benefits
Runtime behavior - The AI agent can handle dependencies that might not have been predicted when the behavior was developed.
Development - goals do not require hand-written embedded plans, and the system can grow elegantly by creating new actions and associated preconditions.  

### Challenges
What is the best way of searching the action space?
How should we represent the world state concisely while still handling a variety of possible variable types for flexible representation of world properties?
